# Ashfield web dev site
This is a site for Ashfield web development, a personal portfolio site for myself that is intended to show my skills in web design for portential employers.

## Changes from the initial plan
* The biggest change is the implementaation of Webpack which has drastically changed the whole structure of the project and has forced a different approach to the project.
* The work experience page has been changed into a services page, showing the services I can offer to any potential clients along with an example image.
* The safari and Opera browser was removed from mobile testing due to time restraints andd access contraints to the devices and software.
* Testing was reduced to not ask about each individual page but the site overall doe to each page being too speific, if the user has issue they may awnser it in one question.
* Birds were removed from the mountain svg.
* The form layout was changed to better suit responcive design and to be more clear as to what is needed.
* The SASS structure was changed to fit what was actually needed in the end, undeeded folders were removed.


## Known issues
* JS needs cleaning up.
* Facebook doesn't link (Intended).
